# Genetic Algorithm and Digital Image Processing 

This project is an activity of the Computer Science Bachelor at the University from the South of Santa Catarina Brazil.

## About the Project

The objective of this project is generate an Image from random pixels using genetic algorithm concepts and processing digital image processing. It consists on the following processes:
- Extract Pixels from original Image;
- Generate an Initial Population with random pixels according to the number especified;
- Compare each individual with the original image throgh the Fitness Function;
- Get the Best Individuals;
- Generate Children from the best Individuals;
- Mutate the Children
- Restart the Process Comparing this New Generation with the original Image
